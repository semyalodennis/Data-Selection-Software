# Data-Selection-Software
This repo provides the software for extracting the region of interest (ROI) from hyperspectral images developed in C++ programming.

# Description
- Data-Selection-Software provides functionalities for extracting ROI from hyperspectral images (.bil format)  
- It was developed in C++ Programming language.    
- The graphical user interface (GUI) of Data-Selection-Software was designed using Qt designer.       
- The C++ tools and libraries used for developing the software include; Standard Template C++ Library, Open Computer Vision Library (OpenCV), Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)   
- Vcpkg package manager from Microsoft was used to install the C++ libraries.    
- The software is fully functional and mainly consists of one main task of extracting ROI from hyperspectral images, and saving the data in a text file (.txt) for further analysis with chemometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques.
